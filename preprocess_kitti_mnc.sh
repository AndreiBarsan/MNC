#     versions of DispNet an FlowNet developed by him and the vision lab at
#     the University of Freiburg.

# TODO(andreib): Separate script for downloading and unzipping data. Make this script call if if 'dataset-root' not given.

# TODO-LOW(andreib): Check for minimum driver version since that's something
# which can't be abstracted by Docker for now.
# TODO-LOW(andreib): Support CPU-only inference. May not be supported by the
# custom MNC layers, which may only have CUDA implementations IIRC.
# TODO-LOW(andreib): Makefile to make things even easier.

Usage: $0 <dataset> <dataset-root> <split> <sequence-id>

A helper script for preprocessing KITTI data for DynSLAM.

Arguments:
   dataset      "kitti-odometry" or "kitti-tracking"
   dataset-root The root directory of the dataset
   split        training or testing
   sequence-id  The ID of the sequence to process.

Example:
    $0 kitti-tracking training ~/my-data/my-kitti/tracking 7
